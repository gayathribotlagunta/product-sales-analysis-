This project focuses on analyzing sales data to uncover business insights, trends, and performance metrics. By using Python and data visualization libraries, the analysis identifies patterns in product sales over time, geography, and categories to support strategic decision-making.

## 📊 Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Time series analysis on sales trends
- Category and region-wise performance insights
- Customer purchase behavior analysis
- Visual dashboards using Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Recommendations based on data patterns

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used contains transactional sales data with the following columns (may vary):

- `Order ID`
- `Product`
- `Quantity Ordered`
- `Price Each`
- `Order Date`
- `Purchase Address`
- `Customer ID`

> *Note: The dataset is either collected from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) or synthesized for academic purposes.*
